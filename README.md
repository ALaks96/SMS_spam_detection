# SMS spam detection

This project was the final evaluation of my Python class at Polytechnique that I developed with a colleague and friend.

Our goal was to create a classifier to detect spams in sms using two methodologies. 

**First methodology** :  Use feature engineering (regex to detect smileys, uppercase words, etc.) which we passed to an XGBoost classifier.

**Second methodology** : Classic approach to use NLP methods (TF-IDF, Bag of words, pre-processing) associated to a Na√Øve bayes classifier.
