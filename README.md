# SMS_spam_detection
This project was the final evaluation of my Python class at Polytechnique. My goal was to create a classifier to detect spams in sms using two methodologies. First methodology was to use feature engineering and XGBoost. Second methodology was a classic approach to use NLP methods associated to a Na√Øve bayes classifier.
